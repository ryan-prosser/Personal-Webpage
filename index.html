    <li>Going to the gym</li>

  <h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

  <p>I graduated from Endicott College in 2022 with a bachelors in Marketing and Business Management. While there I was a member of the varsity baseball team but took part in many other intramural teams as well.</p>

  <p>I started my journey with Thinkful to explore a new career opportunity I believed I would enjoy more. I am so excited to keep going and see where it takes me.</p>

  <p>If you are looking for a new developer who's hungry to learn and keep growing within the industry, please reach out! I can't wait to connect with others within the industry!</p>
